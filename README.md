# Hangman-Word-Guess

link to the application website : https://tinedanzer.github.io/Hangman-Word-Guess/

This application uses front-end Javascript/Jquery logic, bootstrap and little animation to present a word guess game.
On completion you get a reward, on failure...

There shouldn't be any bugs, but if you find some... please let me know! Thank you.
